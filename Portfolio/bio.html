                    <h3>Hello! <br> My name is Halil</h3><br>
                    I'd like to share a little bit about myself with you, born in Toronto, Ontario <br>
                    and raised in the 90's. From a young age I have always been intruiged by computers, <br>
                    from the software they ran, to the engineering involved to make the software runable. <br>
                    I was the classic kid who first developed an interest in coding when I learned what <br>
                    you could do with various hacks in Counter Strike 1.6, and with time that interest <br>
                    grew to what it is today. I am an aspiring Software Developer, and currently a student <br>
                    at the Humber College Institue of Technology and Advanced Learned. I am capable of <br>
                    working in teams and solo, and I am very excited to pursue this career. <br>
                    I look forward to my future in this industry, and can not wait to see the evolution <br>
                    of Software Development and Technology as a whole.
